# TODO
- Save files
- Add bomber attack (explosion)
- AOE attack
- Fixed map type
- Add another tile type
- Powerup
- Tile collisions
    - Make it not shit
- Player health
- Fix memory leaks on sprites, if we need to just allocate a bigger array than needed...
    - Slightly wastes memory, but means all memory is allocated up front for levels.
